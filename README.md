## Features

- **Investment Management**: Add, view, and manage investments with a user-friendly interface.
- **Internationalization**: Supports English and Arabic languages using `react-i18next`.
- **Validation**: Form validation using `yup` and `react-hook-form`.
- **State Management**: Efficient state handling with Redux Toolkit.
- **UI Components**: Consistent and responsive design with Chakra UI.

## Decisions and Trade-offs

Key architectural and tooling decisions were made to balance functionality, maintainability, and developer experience:

- **Chakra UI vs. Tailwind CSS**: Opted for Chakra UI for its component-based approach and built-in accessibility features, while Tailwind CSS is included for utility-first styling where fine-grained control is needed. This hybrid setup offers both structure and flexibility.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Chosen over traditional Redux to reduce boilerplate and simplify state management with features like `createSlice` and built-in immutability.
- **React Hook Form with Yup**: Selected for performant form handling and type-safe validation, avoiding unnecessary re-renders compared to other solutions like Formik.
- **Vite**: Preferred over Create React App for its faster development server and optimized build process, improving the developer experience.
- **TypeScript**: Integrated throughout to enforce type safety, catch errors early, and improve code maintainability.

## Bonus Tasks

The following bonus features have been implemented:

- **TypeScript Excellence**: Implemented strong typing for Redux slices and API responses using interfaces and generics, ensuring robust and predictable data flow.

- **AI Tools**: Utilized Cursor (an AI-powered IDE) for code suggestions, refactoring, and error detection, streamlining development and improving code quality.

## AI Tools

- **Cursor**: Employed for intelligent code completion, refactoring suggestions, and real-time error detection, significantly boosting productivity and ensuring consistent code quality.
